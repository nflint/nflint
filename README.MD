# 👋 Hi, there!

Tech leader by day, mountain enthusiast by... also day 🏔️ (work-life balance is important!)

## 🎯 What I'm About

I'm a seasoned Technical Leader who's helped scale companies from scrappy startups to tech giants. Currently plotting my next adventure while consulting with healthcare startups through Mindshare Ventures.

### 🚀 Career Highlights
- Started an digital agency building ecommerce solutions (among other cool things) bootstrapping and running the busines for 12 years before an exit
- Helped grow PillPack from $30M → $300M (then Amazon came knocking 💰)
- Helped to launch Amazon Pharmacy
- Launched Amazon Pharmacy's Auto-Refill system (because who remembers to order meds?)
- Built Packalytics, a growth ops platform that made everyone's life easier
- Currently building a tool to help streamline the job hunting process

### 📈 Current Work Projects (all consulting)
- Driving strategy at a pre-series A by aligning the team on the 5 year strategic plan in advance of fundraising efforts - this company is going to change the zero party data story
- Technical roadmap and GA launch plan for music industry start-up (VIDA) - I have little doubt these guys will be changing how artists interact with fans
- Helping a variety of smaller healthcare companies with streamlining their tech and operations to drive great efficiency and save $$ 

### 🎮 Tech Stuff I Geek Out On
- AWS 
- Data Engineering & Analytics
- Growth Operations

## 🏃‍♂️ When Not Making Sh*t Happen

You'll find me:

- 🚵 Riding Park City's epic singletrack
- 🏄‍♂️ Chasing waves (when I can escape the mountains)
- 👨‍💻 Tinkering with side projects (because old habits die hard)
- 👧 Raising two awesome kids 

### 🛠️ Current Side Projects
I might not write as much code these days, but I still love building things. Currently experimenting with:
- Building micro app that leverage AI for everyday stuff
- Growth automation tools
- Whatever shiny new tech catches my eye
