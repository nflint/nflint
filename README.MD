# 👋 Hi, there!

Tech leader by day, mountain enthusiast by... also day 🏔️ (work-life balance is important!)

## 🎯 What I'm About

I'm a seasoned Technical Program Manager who's helped scale companies from scrappy startups to tech giants. Currently plotting my next adventure while consulting with healthcare startups through Mindshare Ventures.

### 🚀 Career Highlights
- Started an digital agency building ecommerce solutions (among other cool things) bootstrapping and running the busines for 12 years before an exit
- Helped grow PillPack from $30M → $300M (then Amazon came knocking 💰)
- Launched Amazon Pharmacy's Auto-Refill system (because who remembers to order meds?)
- Built Packalytics, a growth ops platform that made everyone's life easier
- Turned a 90-minute pharmacy call center response time into 5 minutes (you're welcome!)
- Currently building a tool to help streamline the job hunting process

### 🎮 Tech Stuff I Geek Out On
- AWS (it's like Legos, but for grownups)
- Data Engineering & Analytics
- Growth Operations
- Healthcare Tech
- Enterprise Architecture

## 🏃‍♂️ When Not Making Spreadsheets

You'll find me:
- 🎿 Shredding pow in the Wasatch Mountains
- 🚵 Bombing down Park City's epic singletrack
- 🏄‍♂️ Chasing waves (when I can escape the mountains)
- 👨‍💻 Tinkering with side projects (because old habits die hard)

### 🛠️ Current Side Projects
I might not write as much code these days, but I still love building things. Currently experimenting with:
- Healthcare tech innovations
- Growth automation tools
- Whatever shiny new tech catches my eye
